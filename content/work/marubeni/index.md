### Design Challenges & Considerations
Marubeni is a multinational company, which consists of many departments under the same roof. As it's often the case when multiple identities cohexist, the main challenge has been keeping a consistency of space and brand identity throughout the office, while atomically meeting each deparment's needs.

After I carried the analysis of the current work practices and how Marubeni's employees used the space, I identified the lack of variety of meeting rooms' sizes as an issue; I have therefore introduced smaller 2-4-6 people meeting rooms, immediately reducing the waste of functional space.

I have also introduced informal meeting and multifunctional areas, placing them carefully so that no department could claim ownership of any communal space.

Lastly, I had to introduce the new design gradually, by splitting the work in multiple stages, without interfering with the staff which occupied the building throughout the entire project.
