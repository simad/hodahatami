### Design Challenges & Considerations
Combining two offices into one brought unique challenges to tackle:
1.  The need to show a reflection of Hitachi's strong brand throughout the space. This has been particularly difficult since Hitachi's primary colour is red; although red is a very powerful colour, using it too extensively gives an aggressive vibe to a space, which can be off-putting for a workplace.
1. Understanding the needs of two entirely different teams requires a very thorough analysis. I needed to evaluate and shape a new identity for the office before being able to transform the space.
1. I had to find a way to seamlessly blend old and new furniture to meet the client's budget requirements.

I have decided to use the majority of the branding colour in the reception and main areas where collaboration and teamwork is encouraged. In other areas, I have thoughtfully introduced red as a subtle accent to keep consistency throughout the entire space.
