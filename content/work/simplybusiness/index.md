### Design Challenges & Considerations
The overall project addressed the workspace needs of a young group of Millennials. Simply Business lacked a strong brand identity which I have compensated by using strong, bold colours. 

I have created collaborative spaces using high benches and booths; these areas were placed next to teams, to achieve  effortless collaboration.
In particular, I paid attention to the acoustics of the office, to maximise the use of open-plan areas. 

The careful use of furniture allowed a simple transition between formal and informal work spaces, while considering the wellbeing of the employees.
