### Design Challenges & Considerations
The overall project addressed the workspace needs of a young group of Millennials. Collaborative spaces were created using high benches and booths. These areas were placed
next to adjacent teams, for effortless collaboration to be achieved. The
careful use of furniture allowed a simple transition between formal and informal work spaces while considering wellbeing for individuals at work.
